Software Requirement Specification report for Student Result
Management System.
Objective: Student Result Management System
Introduction:
This document aims at defining overall software requirement for STUDENT RESULT
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. Efforts have been made to define the requirements exhaustively and
accurately.
The STUDENT RESULT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM is a web development project aimed at creating
a user-friendly and efficient platform for managing student results. The system will enable
educational institutions to input, store, and retrieve student results securely, providing a centralized
and organized approach to result management.
Purpose:
The main purpose of the Student Result Management System project is to create a user-friendly
and efficient platform for educational institutions to manage student academic records securely,
enabling easy access to results, streamlined communication, and data-driven decision-making.
Moreover, the user can check all these features from their home
Scope of Project:
This project has a large scope as the application will manage the information about various students enrolled in this course in different years, the subjects offered during different semesters of the course, the marks obtained by the
various students in various subjects in different semesters. The application will greatly simplify and speed up the
result preparation and management process. Main Points are:-
• Simplified Management of Student Profiles.
• Generate summary report regarding student information.
• User Satisfaction.
• Role-Based access control.
• Real-time Information Publishing through system alerts.
OVERALL DESCRIPTION:
Product Description:
The Student Result Management System (SRMS) is a web development project aimed at creating
an efficient platform for managing student academic records. It enables educational institutions to
input, store, and retrieve student results securely, streamlining result management processes.
Product Function:
The system facilitates result input, user authentication, database management, reporting, and security
measures to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of student data.
•The system allows authorized users, such as teachers or administrators, to input student results into the
database.
•Users can enter marks obtained by students in different subjects and semesters, along with relevant details
like student ID, subject ID, and semester information.
•Users are required to log in using unique credentials, such as username and password, to gain access to the
system.
•It includes functionalities for data validation, normalization, and indexing to maintain data integrity and
optimize performance.
•Database management tasks also include data backup, restoration, and archival to prevent data loss and
ensure data availability.
•Users can generate summary reports regarding student performance, subject-wise analysis, semester-wise
comparison, and more.
USER CLASSES AND CHARACTERISTICS:
User Classes:
•Administrators: Manage system configurations, user roles, and access permissions.
•Teachers: Input student results, generate reports, and monitor student performance.
•Students: View their own results and academic progress.
•Registrar: Oversee the overall result management process and system functionality.
Characteristics:
•Administrators: Have full access to system functionalities.
•Teachers: Access limited to result input and reporting features.
•Students: Can only view their own results and academic information.
•Registrar: Manages overall system operations and user access.
General Constraints-
•Adherence to privacy and data protection regulations.
•Compatibility with modern web browsers and devices.
•Scalability to accommodate increasing data and user load.
•Users must have their correct usernames and passwords to enter into their online accounts
and do actions.
FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTSFunctional requirements are the following:
•User authentication: Implement a secure login system where college administrators, faculty,
and staff can access the SRMS using unique credentials.
•Result management: Enable faculty members to input and update student result data for
various courses and semesters. This includes recording grades, exam scores, and
attendance records, providing a comprehensive view of student academic performance.
•Search functionality: Allow college staff to search for specific student records based on
criteria such as student ID, course name, semester, or academic year.
•Reporting: Generate detailed reports on student performance, including grade summaries,
course-wise analysis, and progress over multiple semesters.
•Security measures: Implement encryption techniques to protect sensitive student data
stored within the SRMS. Access controls should be in place to restrict access to certain
functionalities or data based on user roles and permissions, ensuring data confidentiality and
integrity.
•User interface: Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows college staff to
navigate the SRMS easily.
•Compatibility: Ensure that the SRMS is compatible with various web browsers and devices
commonly used by college staff, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and
smartphones.
•Integration: Enable integration with existing college systems such as student information
systems (SIS), learning management systems (LMS), and administrative databases.
•Scalability: Design the SRMS to handle increased data and user load as the college grows.
•Maintenance: Provide regular updates, backups, and technical support to ensure the
smooth operation of the SRMS.

NON- FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
Non-functional requirements (NFRs) are crucial aspects of a software system that describe how it
should perform, rather than what it should do. They define the overall attributes such as
performance, security, usability, and maintainability. Below is a detailed list of non-functional
requirements for the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document of a Student Result
Management System website:
1. Performance Requirements:
- Response Time:
- The SRMS must respond promptly to user requests and generate reports within acceptable time
frames, even under high user loads.
- Throughput:
- The system should support a minimum of 100 concurrent users without significant performance
degradation.
- Scalability:
- The system should be scalable to accommodate an increase in the number of users and
resources.
2. Availability:
- The system should be available 99.9% of the time, excluding scheduled maintenance. -
Planned downtime for maintenance should not exceed 2 hours per month and should occur
during off-peak hours.
3. Reliability:
- The system should be capable of recovering from a failure within 15 minutes with minimal data
loss.
- Backup and recovery procedures should be regularly tested to ensure reliability.
4. Security Requirements:
- Authentication and Authorization:
- Users should be authenticated before accessing the system, using secure login credentials. -
Role-based access control should be implemented to restrict unauthorized access to sensitive
information.
- Robust encryption, access controls, and data protection measures must be implemented to
safeguard student data from unauthorized access or breaches.
- Data Encryption:
- All sensitive data, including user credentials, should be encrypted during transmission and
storage.
5. Usability Requirements:
- The user interface should be intuitive and user-friendly, with clear navigation and minimal learning
curve.
6. Compatibility Requirements:
- The system should be compatible with major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
and their latest versions.
- It should be responsive and compatible with various devices, including desktops, laptops,
tablets, and smartphones.
7. Maintainability:
- The system should allow for easy updates and modifications without causing significant downtime.
8. Scalability:
- The system should be designed to scale horizontally to accommodate an increase in users
and data.
- Load balancing mechanisms should be in place to distribute the load evenly across multiple
servers.
9. Interoperability:
- The system should be able to integrate with external systems, such as databases, external
libraries, and authentication services.
10. Compliance:
- The system should comply with relevant laws, regulations, and standards, including data
protection laws.
